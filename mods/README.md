# Gimkit WorldEdit
Gimkit WorldEdit is a tool to help you make Gimkit maps faster and easier, with an emphasis on making repetitive tasks quicker! It currently doesn't support a lot of commands, but it will be expanded in the future

## /flip coordinate
This command flips the selection either horizontally or vertically. You can specify either "x" or "y" to show which coordinate you want to flip. (X = Horizontal, Y = Vertical)

## /scale by-to amount
This command lets you scale the props in a selection to or by an amount. For the by-to argument, you specify wheither you want to scale the objects *by* the amount, or *to* the amount. The amount argument is the number you want to scale by/to.

## /speed amount
